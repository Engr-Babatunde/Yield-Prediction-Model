# Yield-Prediction-Model
# 🌾 Yield Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based **Yield Prediction Model** developed using agricultural datasets. It aims to predict crop yield based on historical data such as rainfall, temperature, soil conditions, and crop type.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help stakeholders in the agricultural sector — such as farmers, planners, and agronomists — make **data-driven decisions** by forecasting crop yields under different environmental and input conditions.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Uncertainty in crop yield due to climate variability and other factors can affect food security and planning. With this model, we aim to:

- Predict yield based on key features (rainfall, soil quality, farm size, sunlight,fertilizer etc.)
- Evaluate different machine learning models for best accuracy
- Visualize key insights and feature impacts

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes:
- Features: rainfall, soil quality, farm size, sunlight,fertilizer usage
- Target: Yield (tons per hectare)

> 📁 Note: The dataset used in this project is available via [/kaggle/input/crop-yield-of-a-farm](#).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Regression Models)
  

## 🧠 ML Models Applied

- Linear Regression
- Ridge

### ✅  Model Performance

> The model performance was validated using cross-validation and a train-test split approach.

## 📈 Visualizations

Key charts included:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature importance plots
- Actual vs Predicted scatter plots
